\begin{abstract}
    TCP/IP networking stacks included in most modern operating systems are opaque to the user and mostly unconfigurable. This article aims to design and produce a coherent specification for an efficient, high performance TCP/IP network stack that can be used as a software library, standalone application or system-wide daemon to provide network access to many applications. It is provided as a learning and academic research tool that can be tweaked, extended and analysed in depth to aid in gaining a better understanding of how operating systems handle networking and TCP/IP as whole.

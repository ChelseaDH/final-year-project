\section{Specification}
    % How you analysed the problem
    % Give an appropriate specification of the solution

    % Requirements from journal
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item This project must produce a TCP/IP implementation that runs completely in Linux userspace with no/minimal kernel modification
    %     \item This project must follow the original RFC 793~\cite{rfc793} specification for TCP
    %     \item This project must provide a network stack as a library such that it can be easily implemented in other software
    %         \begin{itemize}
    %             \item There should be sufficient documentation to demonstrate examples of how this can be achieved
    %         \end{itemize}
    %     \item This project should provide sufficient interface to the user to view the inner workings of a TCP connection
    %     \item This project could implement modern TCP extensions such as Window Scaling, Selective \texttt{ACK} and Congestion Control.
    % \end{itemize}

    % Define specific behavior or functions
    % what a software system should do
    \subsection{Functional Requirements}

    % A requirement that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors.
    % constraints on how the system should do so
    % elaborates a performance characteristic
    \subsection{Non-functional Requirements}

    % What the user expects the software to be able to do
    \subsection{User Requirements}

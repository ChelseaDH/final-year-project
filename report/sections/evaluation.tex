\section{Evaluation} % Discussion
    % how it went
    \subsection{Issues that I thought were going to be but weren't actually issues}
        % refer to journal section 5
    % how it could be improved
    \subsection{Improvements}
        % send/recv buffer implementation (recv buffer structure is a better design and should be used for send buffers too)
        \subsubsection{Send/Receive Buffers}
            
        % parameterised ip/route specification
        \subsubsection{Addressing Configuration}
            % IP address, routes
            % MAC addresses
        % queue'd out-of-order packets to be re-processed for control (FIN), not just for payload
        \subsubsection{Out-of-order TCP queuing}
    % where the project should go from here
    \subsection{Future Work}
        % everything in improvements, obvs
        % TCP extensions for improved performance/throughput & reduced overhead
        % configuration
            % configurable logging
                % disable anything below particular errors
        % system-wide network daemon with IPC library
            % see journal section 4.4
        \subsubsection{Use cases}

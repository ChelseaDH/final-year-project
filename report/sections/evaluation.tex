    % how it went
    \section{Issues that I thought were going to be but weren't actually issues}
        % refer to journal section 5
    % how it could be improved
    \section{Improvements}
        % send/recv buffer implementation (recv buffer structure is a better design and should be used for send buffers too)
        \subsection{Send/Receive Buffers}
            % send buffer can double-up as being used for retransmission tracking too instead of storing a separate list

        % parameterised ip/route specification
        \subsection{Addressing Configuration}
            % IP address, routes
            % MAC addresses
        % queue'd out-of-order packets to be re-processed for control (FIN), not just for payload
        \subsection{Out-of-order TCP queuing}

        \subsection{Parallel Processing Efficiency}
            % One thread per _established_ TCP connection
                % Do NOT start a thread for every SYN packet to prevent SYN flood DoS attacks

    % where the project should go from here
    \section{Future Work}
        % everything in improvements, obvs
        % TCP extensions for improved performance/throughput & reduced overhead
        % configuration
            % configurable logging
                % disable anything below particular errors
        % system-wide network daemon with IPC library
            % see journal section 4.4
        \subsection{Use cases}

% A detailed account of the implementation and testing of your software
% Explain the conceptual structure of the algorithms.
% Also explain what data structures you used
    % how the algorithms were implemented
% What implementation decisions did you take, and why?
    % There is no need to list every little function and procedure and explain its working in elaborate detail; use your judgement on what is appropriate to include
